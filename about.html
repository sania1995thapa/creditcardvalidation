        <h2>About Cash Cards</h2>
        <p>A cash card is an electronic payment card that stores cash for various types of payments. Cash cards may include <br> bank debit cards, prepaid debit cards, gift cards, and payroll cards. <br>They do not include credit cards since credit cardsare a form of debt rather than cash.<br>
        Cards can be classified on the basis of their issuance, usage and payment by the card holder. <br>There are three types of cards: Debit Card, Credit Card and Prepaid Card.<br> These cards can be issued by banks or other entities too. We will discuss each type of card and the issuance authority for particular type of card.</p>

        <p>Nearly everyone has some form of a banking card. They’re small to carry, super easy to use when spending or depositing money, <br>and they save you from having to lug around wads of cash. And it all happens with just a quick swipe or tap. <br>It is certainly worth knowing the details around credit and debit cards, and <br>it is especially important to  understand the numbers on credit cards. <br>Credit and debit cards have a total of 16 digits printed on the front, though a card can have as many as 19 digits or as little as 13. <br>Like a secret code, card numbers represent different business and personal financial information related to the card owner and the card issuer. </p>

                <h3>Front of the Card</h3>
                <p>Bank branding: This refers to who issued the card. <br>Your card will say either “Debit/Access Card” or “Credit Card” along the top. 
                <br><b>Card number:</b> This is the entire 16-digit sequence printed on the front surface and is one of the pieces of information you’re required to hand over when shopping online.
                <br><b>Cardholder’s name:</b> This is also known as the person who is authorized to use the card. 
                <br><b>Smart chip:</b> This is the small metallic-looking square typically on the left side of the card. It is there for security purposes. 
                <br><b>Expiration date:</b>This appears in smaller print below the row of 16 digits. Like driver’s licenses, cards are only good for a certain amount of time. Before the expiration date arrives, the bank will mail you a new one. 
                <br><b>Payment network logo:</b> This refers to the type of card you are using, such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express, etc. Here, you can see instead of "BANK" written on top right corner as an example of bank logo.</p>
               
            </div>

            <div class="About-col">
                <h3>Back of the Card</h3>
                <p>While debit and credit card numbers are mainly on the front side, the back of the card also features critical information.
                <br><b>Magnetic stripe:</b> The strip that runs across the width of the card is arguably the back’s most notable feature.<br> Whenever you swipe your card, the card reader scans or “reads” this stripe to collect various pieces of information about both the cardholder and the account.<br> Each time someone swipes a card, the reader knows whether or not the card has expired.<br> The strip also denotes whether the account associated with the card has sufficient funds for that particular transaction.
                <br><b>Hologram:</b> This is the small, three-dimensional image near one of the bottom corners of the card. It serves as a security measure first and foremost; these are very hard for counterfeiters to fake.
                <br><b>Signature panel:</b> Every card, debit or credit, must be signed by the card owner before it’s officially ready for use.
                <br><b>Security codes:</b> The security code on a credit or debit card, <br>also known as the CVV, is a group of three digits included below the magnetic stripe and certifies that the card is indeed valid.
