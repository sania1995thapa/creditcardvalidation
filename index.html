            <h2>Cash Cards</h2>
            
            <p>A cash card is an electronic payment card that stores cash for various types of payments. Cash cards may include <br> bank debit cards, prepaid debit cards, gift cards, and payroll cards. <br>They do not include credit cards since credit cards
            are a form of debt rather than cash.</p>
            <p>Cards can be classified on the basis of their issuance, usage and payment by the card holder. <br>There are three types of cards: Debit Card, Credit Card and Prepaid Card.<br> These cards can be issued by banks or other entities too. We will discuss
            each type of card and the issuance authority for particular type of card.

                    <h3>Debit Card</h3>
                    <p>Debit Card means the card which can be used to withdraw cash up to the limit present in customer's bank account. They are also known as bank card, plastic card or check card. These are issued by banks only. this card can be used domestically
                    and internationally (provided it is enabled for international use.)</p>

                    <h3>Credit Card</h3>
                    <p>Unlike debit cards, in case of credit cards, a customer can also withdraw beyond the amount of money present in its bank account. But there is a limit for each credit card up to which extra money can be withdraw and also time limit up
                    to whihc the extra money withdran should be paid back. These are issued by banks or other entitites approved by RBI. These cards can also be used domestiocally and internationally.</p>

                    account. Maximum amount to be stored is Rs 1,00,000. These cards can be used only domestically.</p>

                    <h3>What is the actual problem then?</h3>

But have it came across your mind that the credit card or debit card that you'er making just by hearing some agents are they geniune one? Because there are many chances that those agents are non other than fraudsters and they have given you fake credit card with fake card number on it!? But the question arises now that, how will someone check that the credit card they are having its number is fake or not?</p>
